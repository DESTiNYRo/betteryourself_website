Hello all! 
I would like to introduce my Better Yourself website 

Through Codepaths Intro to Web Dev 101 course I took in the fall of 2023, I was able to create a starter website.

It's purpose is to help those who carry self doubt and mental health issues. It shows different ways they can focus on an issue they have to improve themselves.

This is not the final product.
I would like to document the growth of it and the changes I make along the way.

Enjoy.
